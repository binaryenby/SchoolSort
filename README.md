# SchoolSort
Simple program to sort a specifically formatted list of schools. (Originally a college assignment)

This program parses a text file with specific formatting and makes each line a separate instance of the School class.
Several comparators are available in order to sort the list of schools by values such as state, zip code, number of students enrolled, etc.
It also has a method which writes the newly sorted list of schools to a text file.

The order of sorting can be changed by editing the main method. Its current configuration is simply what my professor asked for in the assignment.
This program can also be incorporated by other java programs in order to use its Comparator methods and its file parsing and writing methods.

I plan to add more to this and to provide javadoc style comments for each method and class.
